1) EXPORT a database from an Azure Managed Instance by creating a .bacpac file using SqlPackage.exe:

SqlPackage.exe /Action:Export /ssn:tcp:yourmanagedinstance.public.12345qwerty.database.windows.net,3342 /sdn:YourDatabaseName /su:yourusername /sp:YourP@$$word! /tf:C:\temp\YourDatabaseName.bacpac /p:VerifyExtraction=false /p:Storage=File

YOU SHOULD RUN THE COMMAND ABOVE USING CMD FROM THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORY:

C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\160\DAC\bin 
  
This is beacuse the SqlPackage.exe is located there.
160 might be replaced by the relvant folder (for example 140).

To change directory in cmd, simply run "cd" followed by your location 
For example:
cd C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\160\DAC\bin

2) IMPORT the datbase to your local instance file using the .bacpac file:

SqlPackage.exe /a:Import /sf:C:\temp\YourDatabaseName.bacpac /tdn:YourDatabaseName /tsn:YOUR-SERVER-NAME*


*use the following T-SQL command to get your server name:
PRINT @@SERVERNAME
